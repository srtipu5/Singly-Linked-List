# Singly-Linked-List
-->> A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
-->> In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.
-->> In Linked-List, Insertion and deletion is faster than array.But traversing or searching is slower than array.
-->> Linked-List is dynamic type data structure.
